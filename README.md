# Improvements
- Couldn't really finalize the Pricing logic(I finished the BuyNowPrice scenario) in the List screen.
- Couldn't finish ordering the latest listings by Start Date.
- Couldn't complete displaying the Toasts.
- Dao/Dto Unit testing could be improved by introducing a json file to mimic server response.
- Fragment navigation could be improved by introducing a screen action queue plugin.
